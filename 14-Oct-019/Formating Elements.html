	  <b>Computer</b><!--bold--> is one thing without which we cannot imagine our life. It has become an important part of life for the modern day people.<strong>Computer has been introduced as a compulsory subject in schools to help the kids learn about the same from an early age.</strong><!--strong Tag--> It is essential to teach students about this machine as this is what they would be required to work on as they grow up.<small>The current working generation had to attend special training programs to learn about the various aspects and uses of the computers in order to use them.</small> However, the newer generation is being taught about it as a subject in school so that they do not face any such problem in the future.<mark>Special computer labs are set up in the schools and trained computer teachers are employed to teach the subject.</mark> Knowledge about the use of computer is indeed essential these days.<em><q>This is because most of the tasks today are carried out via these machines.</em></q><!--emphasized text and Qoutation Tag-->

		A computer is a <sub>machine that can be instructed</sub><!--subscripted--> to carry out sequences of arithmetic or <sup>logical operations automatically</sup><!--superscripted--> via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs.<em>These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</em>A"complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system.<del>Now-a-days,computer is a very useful machine.</del><!--delete Tag-->This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.<strong>Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.</strong> This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as <ins>industrial robots and computer-aided design,</ins><!--insert Tag--> and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones.<q>The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.</q>The <abbr title="software development life cycle.">SDLC</abbr><!--Abbrevation Tag--> is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process.<cite>SDLC is a structure followed by a development team</cite><!--work as title tag--> within the software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain and replace specific software.

			<q> <!--Quotation Tag-->
			   Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices. Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations. Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms. More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century. The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II.
